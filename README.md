# Attendance System

It is a basic attendance system made for Smart India Hackathon.

The problem statement was provided by Government of Maharashtra so the website was made to be cheap and scalable fast.
The project was developed by a group of 6 members.
We made a simple attendance system where the student is required to scan their ID card to be marked present.
